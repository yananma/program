[PyCharm 配置](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/usage/pep582/#pycharm)    

```python 
Mark __pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib as Sources Root. Then, select as Python interpreter a Python installation with the same <major.minor> version.   

Additionally, if you want to use tools from the environment (e.g. pytest), you have to add the __pypackages__/<major.minor>/bin directory to the PATH variable in the corresponding run/debug configuration.   
```
